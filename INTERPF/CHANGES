You will find descriptions of the changes to the INTERPF version 3
source code in this file. Each release will be a complete tar file
such as this. 

The current release is 3.7 (December 23, 2004)

========================================================
Bug fixes and Changes in release 3.7

1. Bug fixes:

- When SKINTEMP is used, only average temp is produced for TSEASFC 
  in LOWBDY file.

  Affected file:
  src/module_all_io.F

- Change default value for namelist variables psfc_method
  from logical to integer.

  Affected file:
  namelist.input, namelist.input.SOC

- Ensure consistency of the CP constant across programs.

  Affected file:
  src/module_phys_consts.F

2. Changes and improvements

- Set min RH to be 1% (down from 5%). If a min of 5% was using
  during the regridder stage - the min in INTERPF will be around 5%.

  Affected file:
  src/module_diags.F 

- Add compiler flags for Cray X1. Thanks to Peter Johnsen from
  Cray

  Affected files:
  Makefile
  src/module_hydro_interp.F
  src/module_nh_interp.F
  src/module_util.F

- Add INTEL compiler flags. Default will remain PGI. To compile
  with INTEL, type "make intel"

  Affected file:
  Makefile

========================================================
Bug fixes and Changes in release 3.6

1. Bug fixes:

- The moisture variables going into MM5 are mixing ratios, not 
  specific humidities. Changes have been made to the comments and 
  header information so that they are now consistent with this.

  Affected files:
  src/module_all_io.F, module_lateral_bdy.F

2. Changes and improvements

- Add an option to use a different method to compute surface pressure. 
  This option is controlled by the new namelist variable psfc_method in
  namelist record4. This new option improves surface pressure calculation
  for regions where strong inversion exists in the lower troposhere.

  Affected files:
  namelist.input, namelist.input.SOC
  src/Makefile, interpf.F, module_all_io.F, module_diags.F

- Add sea ice fraction field in the lower boundary file. This field
  may be used by MM5 model when polar physics option is chosen.

  Affected file:
  src/module_all_io.F

- Change the calls to subroutine "clean_rh" to 3d calls, rather
  than KX 2d calls. This prevents potential problems from running on
  some computers.

  Affected files:
  src/interpf.F, module_util.F

- Removing optimization for compilation on IBM - it was too slow.

  Affected file:
  Makefile

========================================================

Bug fixes and Changes in release 3.5

1. Bug fixes:

- Correct an error in computing mixing ratio when namelist
  option WRTH2O is set to FALSE. Thanks to Lt Col Mike Walters of AFIT.

  Affected file:
  src/module_diags.F

2. Changes and improvements

- Allow additional 3D fields to pass through, and compute lateral
  boundary conditions for model microphysical fields (e.g. cloud
  and rain water, cloud ice and snow, etc.) if they are present
  in the input files.

- Add comments in namelist back. If you are using a machine that
  doesn't like comments in namelist, copy namelist.input.SOC to
  namelist.input.

  Affected file:
  namelist.input

- Change default output time periods in interpf.deck.cray.

  Affected file:
  interpf.deck.cray

========================================================

Bug fixes and Changes in release 3.4

1. Bug fixes:

- Uncomment the STOP statement when INTERPF detects an out-of-order
  interpolation. (Change in tar file since 8/11/00.)

  Affected file:
  src/module_hydro_interp.F

- Correct ground temperature calculation problem if usesfc = .F..
  Now the recalculated lowest sigma level temperature is used to 
  approximate ground temperature. (Change in tar file since 3/8/00.)

  Affected file:
  src/interpf.F

2. Changes and improvements:

- Simplify the way make is done. Now one needs only to type 'make'
  to compile on one's machine. (Change in tar file since 6/7/00.)

  Affected files:
  Makefile, configure.rules, macros_pregrid, macros_regridder (new)
  src/Makefile

- Starting from release-3-4, INTERPF will be able to generate a 
  time-dependent LOWBDY file for SST, snow cover, sea ice, if these
  fields exist in the input. INTERPF will create a time-averaged SST
  if the input field is SKINTEMP. When time-averaged SST is created,
  snow cover and sea ice will also not change with time either. Only 
  the first-time-period fields will appear in the LOWBDY file.

  Affected file:
  src/interpf.F, module_all_io.F 

- Making all time periods the default number of time periods to 
  be in MMINPUT_DOMAINx file. Previously the default number of 
  time period is 1. (Change in tar file since 6/7/00.)

  Affected file:
  src/interpf.F

- Add a check for user-defined full sigma levels, which must monotonically
  decrease from 1 to 0.

  Affected file:
  src/interpf.F

- Change the constant of acceleration due to gravity to be consistent
  throughout the MM5 modeling system (from 9.8 to 9.81).

  Affected file:
  src/module_phys_consts.F


==============================================

Updated 1/25/00:

- Allow processing time period to be less than a day. Use namelist
  variable less_than_24h = .TRUE. in record1, or see Doc/README.namelist
  for an example. Remember though to properly calculate substrate
  temperature for use in MM5 with ISOIL =0 or 1 option, one
  needs a time period of at least a full day.

- A mean SST field is added to LOWBDY output for use in MM5 to
  properly mask the land-sea contrast during nest initialization.

- Allow input pressure levels to vary between times. Set Ptop value
  in namelist record2, or see Doc/README.namelist for an example.

- Calculate mixing ratio from RH instead of specific humidity, since
  MM5 uses mixing ratio.

========================================================

Updated 9/25/99:

- Correct units for lateral boundary fields. 

Updated 8/12/99:

- Added OpenMP parallel directives. Compile options on parallel
  Dec Alpha and IBM are available.

Updated 8/6/99:

- Added Cray batch job deck.
