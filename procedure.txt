  v0.1 Daryl Herzmann akrherz@iastate.edu

This document outlines the pre and post processing of ISU MM5 data for MRED.

1) Download NARR
   location: /mnt/tera11/mred/NARR

   # Edit wget.csh to set the years and months you wish to download
   $ vi wget.csh
   # Run the download script
   $ ./wget.csh
   # Run a script to extract desired Grib fields from whatever was downloaded
   $ ./compact.py

2) Download CFS
   location: /mnt/tera11/mred/CFS

   # Download the CFS data from NCEP
   $ ./fetcher.csh

3) MM5 Preprocessing Step
   location: /mnt/tera11/mred/

   # Edit DRIVE.csh to edit the amount of data you wish to process at once
   $ vi DRIVE.csh
   # Run the script
   $ ./DRIVE.csh

4) Transfer mm5input data over to derecho
   location: /mnt/tera11/mred/mm5input

   # Secure copy over one of the directories found in this location to
   # /ptmp/akrherz/mred/input/

5) Run MM5
   location: /ptmp/akrherz/mred/MM5_gcm/Run (on derecho)

   # Simply run the script for the CFS model run of your choice
   $ ./drive.py 1982111100

6) Harvest the MM5 output back to local storage
   location: /ptmp/akrherz/mred/output (on derecho)

   # Secure copy it to /mnt/tera11/mred/postprocess/data/

7) Convert the output to NetCDF in MRED style
   location: /mnt/tera11/mred/postprocess/

   # Run the script, again, once per run
   $ ./master.py 1982111100
   # Output is placed in /mnt/tera11/mred/postprocess/final/
